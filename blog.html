                        1. 'var': It is function-scoped, meaning a variable declared with `var` is accessible within the function it was declared in. If declared outside any function, it becomes globally scoped. It's important to note that `var` variables can be re-declared and updated. <br>
        
                        2. 'let': It is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it was declared in. `let` variables can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope. <br>
        
                        3. 'const': Like `let`, `const` is also block-scoped. However, `const` variables cannot be updated or re-declared. This doesn't mean they are immutable, it just means the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, if the `const` variable is an object, the properties of the object can still be updated. <br>
        
                        Here's an example to illustrate the difference: <br><br>

                        In JavaScript, 'null' and 'undefined' are both special values that represent the absence of a value. However, they are used in slightly different scenarios. <br>
    
                        'undefined' is the default value of a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is also the value of a function that does not return anything. For example: <br><br>
                        <img src="./images/code 2.png" alt=""><br><br>
    
                        'null', on the other hand, is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable to represent no value or no object. It implies the absence of value or the non-existence of an object. For example: <br><br>
    
                        <img src="./images/code 3.png" alt=""> <br><br>
    
                        In practical use, 'undefined' often means that a variable has been declared but not defined yet, and 'null' is often used to assign 'no value' or 'no object' to a variable. It's also worth noting that JavaScript is loosely typed, so 'undefined' and 'null' are somewhat interchangeable, but using them appropriately can make your code more understandable and prevent potential bugs.

                <h3 class="text-2xl">Question 3: <span class="font-semibold">What do you mean by REST API?</span></h3>
                <div>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a set of rules or conventions for building web services. When a service follows these rules, we call it a RESTful API, or simply a REST API. <br>
        
                        A REST API works by receiving HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returning data, often in the form of JSON, to the client. Here's a brief explanation of these HTTP methods: <br>
        
                        1. GET: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. For example, you might use a GET request to get a list of all users from a database. <br>
        
                        2. POST: This method is used to send data to the server. For example, you might use a POST request to add a new user to a database. <br>
        
                        3. PUT: This method is used to update existing data on the server. For example, you might use a PUT request to change a user's email address. <br>
        
                        4. DELETE: This method is used to delete data from the server. For example, you might use a DELETE request to remove a user from a database. <br>
        
                        One of the key principles of REST is statelessness, which means that each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store anything about the latest request the client made. Each request is processed independently of others.
